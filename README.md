## Recommendation System Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of a recommendation system using a subset of the Amazon Reviews dataset. The goal is to build a model that can provide personalized product recommendations to users based on their past rating behavior. The project uses a collaborative filtering approach, specifically Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), to predict user ratings and suggest new products.

## Data
The dataset used is the Amazon Reviews Electronics (ratings only) dataset, which contains user, product, and rating information. The data was sourced from http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/.

## Technologies Used
- Python

- Numpy

- Pandas

- Scikit-learn

- Matplotlib

- Seaborn

- Scipy
  
- Surprise (SVD model)

## Methodology and Model
The project's core methodology revolves around collaborative filtering, a technique that predicts user preferences based on the preferences of other users. We utilize the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm, implemented via the surprise library, to factorize the user-item rating matrix. This factorization allows us to predict ratings for items a user has not yet rated. The SVD model is trained on a subset of the ratings data, and its performance is evaluated to ensure it provides accurate and meaningful recommendations.

## Results
The model's effectiveness is rigorously evaluated using standard metrics such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). These metrics quantify the difference between the predicted ratings and the actual ratings. We compare the SVD model's performance against a simple baseline, such as a Naive Mean baseline, to demonstrate its superior predictive capability. The results will show that the SVD model significantly outperforms the baseline, providing a solid foundation for a functional recommendation system.

## Future Work
- **Expand the dataset:** Train the model on the full Amazon Reviews dataset for improved accuracy and broader coverage.

- **Explore other algorithms:** Implement and compare other collaborative filtering algorithms, such as k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) or Matrix Factorization with Gradient Descent.

- **Integrate with a web application:** Build a simple front-end application to demonstrate real-time recommendations.

- **Hyperparameter tuning:** Optimize the SVD model's performance by tuning its hyperparameters (e.g., number of factors, learning rate, regularization).
